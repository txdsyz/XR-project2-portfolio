# XR-project2-portfolio
Personal portfolio for the Industrial Project with XR course – Node-RED data integration.

This repository contains my individual work for the Industrial Project with XR course.
I was responsible for building the real-time data integration pipeline using Node-RED,
including data ingestion from API and OPC UA sources for the SIF406 and SIF407 stations.


I developed the Node-RED flows used to collect, parse, clean, and distribute real-time data from:
SIF406 – Warehouse station：API data ingestion (warehouseStatus endpoint)

OPC UA data ingestion (idle, busy, alarm time, etc.)：
SIF406 – Machine station
SIF407-OPC UA data ingestion (in progress due to machine instability)
