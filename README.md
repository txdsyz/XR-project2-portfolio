Personal portfolio for the Industrial Project with XR course – Node-RED data integration.

This repository contains my individual work for the Industrial Project with XR course.
I was responsible for building the real-time data integration pipeline using Node-RED,
including data ingestion from API and OPC UA sources for the SIF406 and SIF407 stations.
